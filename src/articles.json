This season’s most incredible styles are fun, trendy, and chic, whether baggy jeans, statement sequin dresses, or sporty sunglasses. These items will make you appear like a movie star in no time at all. </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:3\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(195,82,156)\">1. Baggy Jeans </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:4\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Trying to pull off a relaxed and casual look is a lot of work. It can be hard to find the right pair of jeans that appeal to your fashion sense. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:5\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Fortunately, Hailey Bieber has found a simple solution to the problem of finding the perfect pair of jeans that makes you feel comfortable yet trendy: baggy jeans. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:6\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">A belt is all you need to complete this look, whether you buy a pair of vintage baggy jeans or new ones. Investing in a pair of baggy jeans is a smart move because they can be easily dressed up or down. Take a cue from Justin Bieber’s wife, Hailey Bieber, and wear them with shoes for a more laidback style. </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:7\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(195,82,156)\">2. Statement Sequin Dresses </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:8\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Are you preparing for an occasion where you want heads turning towards you? Florence Welch and other high-profile celebrities can tell you just what to wear. If you are looking for an evening look that will make a last- <span>ing impression, go for a spectacular sequin dress.</span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:9\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">With this outfit, you will be the talk of the town and the focus of attention everywhere you go. Choose an all-over sequin design in an eye-catching metallic color for a daring look. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:10\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">While classics like gold and silver are always popular, less popular hues like pink may be a fun change of pace. A well-fitted or short style is also a smart choice while wearing sequins since they add texture and weight to the garment. </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:11\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(195,82,156)\">3. Patterned Outfits </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:12\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">While print-on-print florals were favored by Isabel Marant and Lanvin in their recent summer collections, Brandon Maxwell and Versace opted for linear and geometric motifs. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:13\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Jason Wu drew inspiration from tie and dye designs inspired by watercolor representations, while Altuzarra went for tie and dye motifs. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:14\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">All of the designs in the show were unique, but Ayni’s thought-provoking crochet-on-crochet texture concept kept things interesting. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:15\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">It is time to say goodbye to dreary wardrobes and hello to an all-over pattern mashup for the upcoming spring and summer 2022 season, as designers and highend fashion companies embrace the maximalist approach to print patterns. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:16\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">To make a statement, celebrities and designers in major fashion cities have been wearing similar prints or combinations of prints across their entire bodies. </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:17\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(195,82,156)\">4. Slip-on Dresses </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:18\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Slip-on dresses used to be a ‘90s style staple, but they are making a comeback now. These dresses are greatly adored by celebrities since they are simple and easy to style. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:19\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Posing in Miami while wearing a beautiful Michael Kors slip-on dress, the supermodel Bella Hadid took to Instagram to highlight how effortlessly stylish slip-on dresses can look and why we need to have them in our closets. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:20\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">For a more laid-back style, you can wear military boots or an oversized leather coat with a slip-on dress to contrast the feminine nature of the garment. This will give you a more balanced and fascinating look. </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:21\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(195,82,156)\">5.

When looking for a swimsuit like the ones worn by Susie Bubble, look for a style with many patterns and bright colors. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:24\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">You do not always have to wear a one-piece suit, however. Swimwears like Candice Swanepoel’s are an excellent example of how you may appear fashionable at the beach while allowing room for your growing baby bump to stay comfortable. </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:25\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(195,82,156)\">6. Sporty Sunglasses </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:26\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">This season, sporty sunglasses have become one of the most popular spring fashion trends. The design is modern and functional. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:27\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">In addition to using them for genuine sports, such as a trendy jog <span>around the city, they may also be used as a fashion piece. A huge lover of the look, Bella Hadid paired her sporty sunglasses with a pair of baggy pants.</span></paragraph-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:3\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_8-1.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:28\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(195,82,156)\">7. Denim Coats </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:29\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Rejina Pro (a South Korean fashion designer) showed us a look in her spring and summer collection of 2022 that featured 70’s style achieved through a structured and well-fitted denim coat. Since the coat was close-fitting, it managed to accentuate the model’s figure. On the contrary, Loewe (a Spanish fashion luxury brand) exhibited some looks to style denim coats in an oversized manner, and the acid wash technique was used to create an acid wash look. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:30\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">The denim coat is a flexible piece of apparel that can be used both as a fashion statement and a casual clothing item. Not only that, but because of its resilience and adaptability, it serves as the ideal canvas for experimentation, allowing it to transcend seasons and grow through time. </paragraph-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:4\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_8-2.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:31\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(195,82,156)\">8. Printed Jeans </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:32\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">During Milan Fashion Week, Gigi Hadid wore a pair of bandana-print jeans. It is no surprise that printed denim is a major spring trend, given the current popularity of mod, logomania, and graphic prints. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:33\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">From Y2K baggy versions to straight-leg, your beloved jeans are now covered in a campy, fun theme, and they do not have to be exaggerated. Make your denim the focal point of your outfit by pairing it with a basic shirt and sneakers. </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:34\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(195,82,156)\">Wrapping Up </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:35\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">This summer’s musthaves include baggy jeans, sunglasses, sequin dresses, and slip-on dresses.

One simple and fun way to explore new ways to prepare vegetarian dishes is to gather together a group of friends and form a vegetarian cooking club. There’s no need for all members of the club to be practicing vegetarians. There are lots of nonvegetarians who would like to add more vegetables to their diet and want to learn new ways to prepare them.</span></paragraph-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:1\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_33-2.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:3\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">To start a vegetarian cooking club, network with your friends and find a few who are interested in meeting on a regular basis to learn to expand their vegetarian cooking skills. You’ll want to keep the size of your club small since only so many people can fit into a kitchen at the same time. If you don’t have friends who are interested, try contacting a local vegetarian society or group with your idea. They will likely have a variety of members who would be interested in your idea and may be able to provide you with resources for your club. Plan to have your<span> vegetarian cooking club meet once a month at the home of a different member each time. At each meeting, the group will prepare an entree or even a full meal based on the recipe selected at the last meeting. To select the recipes, have several vegetarian cookbooks available at each meeting for discussion and menu planning. You can have a different member select the menu each month for the following meeting. For variety and to learn new vegetarian cooking skills, consider inviting a local chef or member of a local vegetarian society to come in and instruct the group on an occasional basis. To buy the supplies needed for the meal preparation, charge each member of the vegetarian cooking club a monthly fee to be given to the host of the next meeting.</span></paragraph-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:2\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_33-1.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:4\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">For preparation of the monthly vegetarian meal, the members would divide into groups with each working on a particular portion of the vegetarian meal. Once the food is prepared, leave plenty of time for eating together as a group, socializing, and discussion of the various cooking techniques used. This will allow everyone to improve their vegetarian cooking skills. For variety, every few months the vegetarian cooking club can dine at a local vegetarian restaurant. This is a great way to try new vegetarian dishes and expand each member’s culinary options. If you don’t have a vegetarian restaurant, a Japanese, Chinese, or Indian restaurant should offer vegetarian food choices.&nbsp;</paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:5\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">A vegetarian cooking club is a great way to explore the world of vegetarian cooking in a fun and friendly environment. It’ll also help you eat healthier and make new friends in the process.</paragraph-widget></page-widget>",

This was not unusual for my colleagues in the sales department – their job was to earn income for the company that could easily be added up on a calculator.</span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:4\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">But for someone like me coming from a more creative background – writing and editing – Iwas initially flummoxed by this concept. How can the number of hits on an article be the measurement of whether it’s good or bad? </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:5\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Sometimes the <span>silliest or most profane pieces get the most hits. Sometimes a great article gets only two readers because the headline or lead picture wasn’t appropriate. Sometimes an irresponsible article that spouts misogyny or hatred gets shared and read a lot, even if it’s by opponents of that article who are sharing it only to counter it.</span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:6\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">How do you decide the worthiness of a work <span>of art based on the footfall of the art gallery?</span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:7\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">In any case, since it was my job, I accepted this parameter even if I was puzzled by it, and worked towards it. After a year, however, I noticed a pattern. Every time we reached a benchmark, the parameter would change. When we got to a certain number of ‘page views’, we were told we would now be judged on ‘unique visitors’. And then both those numbers were recalibrated. There should be 20 percent growth, they said, which became 100 and even 300 as time went by. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:8\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Then one day, sitting in a board meeting where <span>more numbers were thrown my way, I had an epiphany. The essence of the entire corporate world laid itself bare to me: it was a game of hopscotch. You draw eight or 10 numbered boxes in a pattern on the ground with chalk. You throw your pebble on box one, hop on one foot, fetch it, return. In the next turn, you throw the pebble to box two, fetch it, then box three, and so on until you reach the final number (eight or 10). If you trip or touch the lines, you start over.</span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:9\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">And suddenly, my work appeared like a game of hopscotch. You throw one target, achieve. Then you throw another target, achieve. Then you move further and further. Growth and progress were a game of setting targets. There was nothing else to it. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:10\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Later, I left that job and started following my own passion. Though I did not allow numbers to decide my sense of worth anymore, I decided to continue the game of hopscotch with myself. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:11\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">I’d set a target, achieve it, then move on to the next one. Even if I didn’t feel quite ready or if I had nothing else prepared yet, I’d mark the day on my calendar every month, and then work towards it with single-mindedness. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:12\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Sometimes I’d announce my target and date publicly – say, the first episode of eShe TV – and then the decision became choiceless and I would have to scramble to learn the software or purchase the hardware for the video recording before that date. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:13\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">I noticed a wondrous thing: when you set a target and a date, you automatically tap into a mystical source of energy to achieve it. I never, ever missed my target. I achieved them all, never mind if it sometimes took the mickey out of me. I even once brought out a bumper issue of eShe on time despite my computer crashing two days before my target date. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:14\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">I highly recommend this great game, this enriching, motivating, fun hopscotch of life. It’s <span>almost like a work of art.</span></paragraph-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:1\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_20-1.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:15\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Aekta Kapoor is the founder and editor of eShe, a digital media platform that amplifies women’s voices and stories of our shared humanity. </paragraph-widget></page-widget>",

Is there more opportunity for fame and financial reward or less?</span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:7\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Personally, I am pretty old school, and prefer supporting the artist directly by picking up their vinyl, cassette or CD. It’s also an unparalleled listening experience to sit and immerse yourself in the entire story that the artist wants to tell you, and I do miss those days especially now, when that’s how I wish my art would be consumed. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:8\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">But with attention spans barely lasting between the blink of our eyes, it seems that the only way to gain a listener, or build an audience, or even be noticed by the editorial playlist curators, is by constantly putting out single after single on every streaming platform, every month, just to stay in their periphery and keep them coming back for more. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:9\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">However, for an independent artist this is not a sustainable situation, and I always feel like I am walking a fine line between what feels like selling my soul, or else refusing to play the game and keeping it intact. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:10\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">With the payout being so minimal per stream, it’s the artist that pays the price because we invest so much time, money and energy into putting out a new release, and there’s no one on the other end to listen to or feel the story. </paragraph-widget><container-widget widget-id=\"T:11\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"><paragraph-widget padding=\"16 24 16 24\" background-color=\"#f9f9f9\"><span style=\"color: #999999;\">“&nbsp;</span>As independent artists on streaming platforms, we’re playing a game where the rules constantly change&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #999999;\">”</span></paragraph-widget></container-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:12\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">-Shilpa Ananth </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:13\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">It feels like a very easy and straightforward experience, and as a listener it<span> truly is, as through these streaming platforms you are immediately connected and able to listen to any song you want at any time you want. But as an independent artist, it feels like we’re playing a game where the rules constantly change and we’re set up to lose, like anything we do only makes a difference if we hit a viral moment.</span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:14\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">How do you discover me if you don’t even know I exist? </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:15\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_italic\" style=\"color: rgb(3,166,89)\">What are the challenges of being a woman musician in today’s day and age? </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:16\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">It’s always been a challenge to be a woman in any industry, and for a long time I felt the need to be an accepted member of the elite boys’ club every time I was in a situation where I was the minority. However, as my experience, value for self and understanding of people grew, I stopped caring so much about which club I was allowed in, and started creating a space of mutual respect, support, inclusion and opportunity for more women to rise and realise their worth. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:17\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">With unequal power dynamics, toxic masculinity, uncomfortable advances and rampant misogyny from our male counterparts, women have so much to deal with on a daily basis, on top of all the societal and familial pressure we already deal with regarding ageism, sexism and why we aren’t rushing to get married, have babies and be “settled” already. It’s exhausting. Creating art is one the only reason I am able to stay sane and know that I am on the right path, on<span> the more mentally and emotionally challenging days.</span></paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:18\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_italic\" style=\"color: rgb(3,166,89)\">What are the sources of income for today’s musicians who primarily put up their music for free online? How do you manage? </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:19\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">It’s pretty rough if you’re an upcoming musician doing it all by yourself, because it seems as though you need to manage many different income streams. This includes what you could be making through your streaming platforms, the money that you make from selling merch or when people buy your music online; or else getting paid to be a songwriter for someone else, playing online or in-person shows/festivals where you and your band are paid a good rate regardless of ticket sales, applying for government funding or private grants, working out paid partnerships or sponsorship deals with brands you align with, and the biggest one that could keep getting you paid for life being with a monthly royalty cheque when your music gets placed in movies or big budget shows. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:20\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">So clearly there are many options and paths, but each one requires a good investment of time, research, faith and persistence, and this is why it feels like it can be too much for one person to be able to handle it all and be artistically creative and release new music every month! </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:21\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">I also teach music at the new Berklee College of Music campus in Abu Dhabi, and luckily this is as much my calling as writing, singing and performing music is, so that’s yet another path to explore for artistic and financial freedom. It will allow you time as you work through the rest, and find yourself, space and a like-minded community. </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:22\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_italic\" style=\"color: rgb(3,166,89)\">What are some of the privacy issues, plagiarism, and other threats that you face personally and professionally? </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:23\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">I think anyone that is brave enough to put out an original idea or a piece of their true self out is at risk of having their privacy violated and work plagiarised. And it’s worse if you’re given no credit, and the other person also finds success after ripping off or being ‘inspired’ by your hard work. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:24\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">In order to stay protected, I always register every song I am about to release with a Performing Rights Organisation (PRO) and also register for the copyright of the entire work of art. This way if I ever need to contest a case, I have iron-clad legal proof to back my complaint. </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:25\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_italic\" style=\"color: rgb(3,166,89)\">Do you think a musician needs technical training? How different or difficult would life have been as a musician for you if you weren’t trained? </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:26\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">I think technical training is very important and necessary to go deeper within what you are capable of naturally and instinctually, to open notes within that you didn’t know existed, and to do it without hurting or damaging your instrument in the long term. I honestly don’t know how strong my ears and voice would be without the initial foundation I have from Carnatic classical music training, that started from the age of three. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:27\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">I don’t know how else I would have understood the roots of Western styles of music, specific vocal techniques, and music theory if I hadn’t gone to Berklee in Boston. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:28\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">The knowledge, years of professional experience, along with the talent I was born with, have all empowered me equally, and keep me motivated to keep learning and getting even better. So, I imagine life would be far more difficult and the understanding of my instrument to be shallow and basic had I not gone through any training or sacrifice for my art at all.&nbsp;</paragraph-widget></page-widget>",

When you have a separate area set out for it in your home, you can better concentrate on your work. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:3\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">We’ve rounded together 12 home office design ideas that will inspire you to create a workfriendly environment in your own house. </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:4\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">1. Finding the Suitable Desk and Chair for Your Needs </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:5\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Choosing the proper workstation and chair for a home office is critical. Ensure that your workstation has enough space for your computer and other essentials. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:6\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">An in-tray, reference materials, or a place to jot down notes might all go here. Ideally, it would be best to have a desk that is at least 48” wide. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:7\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">If all you need is a laptop, you can get by with a smaller desk. Larger than </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:8\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">60” is most comfortable for most individuals. An adjustable-height desk is ideal in a home office situation, but it isn’t always practicable. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:9\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Desks with a height range of 28”-30” or less are preferable. Invest your money in a chair that is both comfortable and adaptable. Your back and neck will appreciate it. </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:10\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">2. Use Accessories That Are Homey </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:11\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">When decorating your home office, don’t forget about the little things like a stylish wastebasket and pretty mugs to keep your pencils and trendy notepads and sticky notes. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:12\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Using drapes of the same fabric as the curtains on the bookshelves will cover the utilitarian look of the shelves. Decorate your home with art, whether it’s your children’s framed work or a well-known painting. </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:13\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">3. Use Your Favorite Color to Paint the Walls </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:14\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">It’s time to ditch the “office beige” and find a hue that gets your creative juices flowing. Colors like orange and lime green are popular choices for some people. Others require a soothing color like <span>sea green or sea blue to function.</span></paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:15\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">4. Consider Adding Plants </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:16\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Make your place more inviting by adding some color and vitality. You’ll probably wind up working at the kitchen table despite your best efforts if you don’t create a functional, comfortable, ergonomic, and tidy home office. A beautiful plant is considered to keep you calm and purify the air and be visually appealing. </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:17\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">5. Consider Using a Set of String Lights </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:18\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">A string of lights cast in a soft glow has a meditative quality. You need to get the lighting in your office just right, and a mix of soft and bright lighting can be a fantastic way to vary things up depending on your mood. </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:19\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">6. Organizing and Storing Items </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:20\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">When creating a home office, storage is often disregarded, which can significantly impact your productivity. You should consider your storage needs while planning the layout of your office. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:21\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Your inbox should be <span>located on or near your desk. Keep the work you’re doing at the moment close to hand. A filing cabinet should be closed. You should not overlook reference materials; place them on a shelf near your workstation to always have easy access.</span></paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:22\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">7. Hide Your Cords </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:23\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Ugly cords can be problematic, but you can cover them up with duct tape. Ensure that your equipment is adjacent to an outlet to unplug it if necessary easily. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:24\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">To conceal and protect cords on the desk, plastic or metal caps should be used. With tubing, cord winders, or a wire organizer that is fastened to the desk and elevates the wires off the floor, you can tame the cord jungle on the floor. </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:25\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">8. Use Posters That Relieve Your Stress </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:26\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">When people are happy and healthy, they are more likely to be productive and creative. Your artwork will relieve stress and lift your spirits while also soothing you down after a long day at work or with the kids or dogs interrupting you every two seconds. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:27\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Due to prolonged periods of concentrated work, cognitive weariness is also typical in desk employment. Restoring mental energy and reducing exhaustion-caused stress through art-viewing improves cognitive performance. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:28\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">As a result of the enhanced effectiveness, you will experience a sense of peace and patience. </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:29\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">9. Decorate with a Simple Aesthetic </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:30\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">With minimalist or Scandinavian interior design, you may get rid of the clutter and distractions in your home office. For a minimalist look, go for light natural wood and subtle accent colors like blush pink, sage green, and light blue-grey. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:31\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">They also favor dazzling whites combined with other achromatic tones. If you’re looking to add a splash of color to an otherwise simple space, art prints are excellent. </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:32\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">10. Create a Pleasant View </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:33\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Set up your workspace such that when you look up from your computer screen, you’re not staring at a blank wall. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:34\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Make sure your workspace is well-lit with natural light by hanging a picture over the desk or positioning your chair in front of the door. </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:35\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">11. Make the Most of the Space You Have </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:36\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">It’s essential to keep your belongings in order, so make sure to do so. A cluttered home office is the wrong place to work. Don’t cram printers, filing cabinets, and other office equipment into corners and drawers. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:37\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Put cabinets up to the ceiling with different types of storage and a wall-mounted pin-board to assist in organizing items that you would otherwise cram into a drawer! </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:38\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">12. Go for Botanical Prints </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:39\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Another way to provide a sense of calm to your workstation is through botanical prints. You can get a better sense of nature by focusing primarily on a single plant or a group of plants. </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:40\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">Final Thoughts </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:41\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Many advantages come with working from home, including improved worklife balance and the elimination of commuting time. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:42\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">However, another benefit is the opportunity to create a workspace that you adore. Working from home offers a unique combination of convenience and effectiveness. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:43\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">While it’s essential to have a separate work area from the rest of your home, keeping the two separate is also essential. The home office you design will look great if you stick to the pointers in this article.</paragraph-widget></page-widget>",

Since I am from Gujarat myself, I delved deeper into the Nawanagar jewels to know more. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:4\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Turban ornament (jigha, left) made by Cartier for the Maharaja Sir Ranjitsinghji Jadeja of Nawanagar (right) </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:5\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">The beginning of the 20th century saw a great deal of interest by the Indian maharajas for all things European, particularly jewellery. It also coincided with the visit of the famed jeweller Jacques Cartier to India. I stumbled upon a range of rare jewels that were commissioned by Maharaja Sir Ranjitsinhji Vibhaji Jadeja and Maharaja Digvijaysinhji Jadeja of Nawanagar with Cartier. </paragraph-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:1\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_41-2.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:6\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">And that is where I first came upon the story of the Nawanagar necklace. Commissioned in<span> 1931, the Nawanagar necklace is one of India’s most famous and finest jewels through history. So much so that it was immortalised in a Hollywood movie, worn by the lovely Anne Hathaway in Ocean’s 8!</span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:7\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">The princely state of Nawanagar was ruled by the Jadeja dynasty before Ranjitsinhji came to the throne in 1907. By then, he was a noted cricketer who had played for the English cricket team, Cambridge University and the county of Sussex. In fact, the Ranji<span> Trophy, India’s first-class cricket tournament that has been the breeding ground for scores of international greats, was named in his honour later.</span></paragraph-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:2\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_42-1.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:8\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Ranjitsinhji had another great passion apart from cricket: collecting rare jewels. The ‘Nawanagar Jewels’ that he accumulated were described by his close friend, Jacques Cartier, as “unsurpassed in the world, not perhaps in quantity but certainly in quality.” The collection is considered unique even when compared with other great jewellery collections such as those of the Hyderabad, Baroda, Indore and Kapurthala royal families. One of the reasons is that the pearl fisheries around Gujarat were known to produce natural black pearls – it is no wonder that the Nawanagar royal family had a rare necklace made of these. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:9\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">They also famously had an emerald necklace owned by the Ottoman Sultans, a beautiful lemon-coloured diamond known as the ‘Tiger’s eye’, and many other exquisite pieces. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:10\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Coloured diamonds – Ranji’s favourite – were a large part of his collection, including unusual shades such as pink, blue, green and black. The book Cartier by Hans Nadelhoffer speaks of a red diamond and even a brown diamond bought by the Maharaja, which would no doubt command astronomical prices today. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:11\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">But the most important jewel from the Nawanagar collection is the two-line Cartier diamond necklace called the Nawanagar necklace. It had two strands of firstclass white diamonds, linked on both sides by a pair of square pink diamonds. </paragraph-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:3\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_43-2.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:12\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">The centre pendant comprised several pink diamonds, a large 26-carat blue diamond, a 12-carat green diamond, and the famous 136-carat ‘Queen of Holland’ diamond, even larger than the 105-carat Kohinoor! </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:13\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Its total carat count was around 500 carats. Jacques Cartier described it as “the finest cascade of coloured diamonds in the world” and “a superb realisation of a connoisseur’s dream”. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:14\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">But the connoisseur did not live long enough to enjoy his necklace. It was his nephew and successor Sir Digvijaysinhji Jadeja (1895-1966) who actually wore the necklace several times on state occasions (lead image). He too was a lover of jewellery and further expanded the Nawanagar collection. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:15\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Sadly, the necklace no longer exists except in archival photos. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:16\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">But it was resurrected to celebrity status when Warner Bros collaborated with Cartier to recreate a replica as the centre-piece in Ocean’s 8. Though the design is exactly the same, the necklace used in the movie is reduced in size by 15 to 20 percent and adjusted to Anne Hathaway’s measurements as the original dimensions were for a man. And of course, those aren’t real diamonds; zirconium oxides were used instead. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:17\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">The commissioned piece took 15 artisans eight weeks of high-intensity work at Cartier’s high jewellery workshop in Paris, and was named the Toussaint Necklace after Cartier’s then creative director, Jeanne Toussaint – an independent, pioneering woman who was fascinated by Indian jewellery and inspired by the splendour of the great Indian Maharajas. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:18\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">It’s only fitting that the movie version of the Nawanagar necklace was worn in a women-centric film starring some of Hollywood’s greatest stars, a fun flick with high fashion and glamour!</paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:19\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_italic\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">First published in eShe’s September 2019 issue. </span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:20\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_italic\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">Syndicated to CNBCTV18 </span></paragraph-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:4\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_43-1.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:21\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_italic\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">Puja Shah is the founder of Aurus Jewels based in Ahmedabad.

Everyone’s marriage is unique, and no one’s relationship is ideal. There are, of course, times when disagreements and feelings of loneliness plague a good marriage.</span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:2\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Prolonged periods of loneliness in wedlock may have long-term detrimental effects. Individuals can be committed and still feel alone in a marriage. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:3\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(138,164,175)\">What Is Loneliness in a Marriage? </span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:4\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">To be married to someone and have little or no in-depth communication is a surefire prescription for loneliness. According to most experts, just sharing a home but no connection with someone is not the cure for loneliness. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:5\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Being a married person may still leave you feeling alone if your emotional needs are not met since marriage is built on the foundation of emotional support. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:6\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(138,164,175)\">Reasons for Loneliness in a Marriage </span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:7\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(48,64,141)\">1. Relying Too Much on One Another for Happiness </span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:8\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">An unhealthy dependence on one another may strain relationships and leave individuals vulnerable to loneliness as the two persons in the relationship go through periods of estrangement and detachment from one another. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:9\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">It is easy to blame your partner for all of your happiness and self-worth. Whether you are in a relationship or not, you must be able to feel fulfilled and whole as an individual. Individuals should not have to rely solely on marriage to avoid feeling lonely. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:10\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(48,64,141)\">2. Emotionally Abusive Partner </span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:11\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Being married to an emotionally and mentally abusive person would almost certainly result in periods of prolonged loneliness. You may feel like walking on eggshells when confronting your partner and eventually avoid any disagreement if you fear your spouse’s aggressive conduct and verbal beatings. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:12\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(48,64,141)\">3. Events That Cause Anxiety </span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:13\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">A couple’s shared difficulties can sometimes lead to disagreements in their relationship. A stressful or traumatic incident can strain the strongest of marriages, and it can feel even more difficult if it emphasizes or exposes faults in your marriage. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:14\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">If you feel that your spouse is not being supportive or compassionate after you undergo a traumatic event, it may make the situation much tougher. Even after the unpleasant incident has passed, you may still feel abandoned and lonely. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:15\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(48,64,141)\">4. Incompatibility Issues </span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:16\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">A relationship can become a dead end if the two people involved are not compatible. Discontent, bitterness, intolerance, and dissatisfaction can overtake what previously seemed like a carefree existence. If you find yourself in a relationship like this, you may experience loneliness. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:17\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(138,164,175)\">How to Treat Loneliness in a Marriage? </span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:18\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(48,64,141)\">1. Consult a Marriage Therapist </span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:19\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Perhaps you and your partner need a little tender loving care. If your spouse is open to it, couples counseling with a therapist can help you and your spouse figure <span>out what aspects of your relationship or marriage are making you feel lonely. A therapist may even offer advice on how to overcome the problem.</span></paragraph-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:1\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_46-1.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:20\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(48,64,141)\">2. Consider Your Partner’s Perspective </span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:21\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">You do not always have to look at things the way you do since your partner’s views may differ. You may mistake acts of love and affection from your partner as intervention, and they may eventually become a source of conflict. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:22\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">It is time to stop judging each other and spend a few moments contemplating your partner’s point of view before responding. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:23\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(48,64,141)\">3. Get Involved in Other Activities</span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:24\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">tact with your spouse may make you feel less lonely while improving your connection with them. Activities like joining a jogging or cycling club, volunteering, or a hobby club can help you divert your attention from your relationship and give you something else to look forward to. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:25\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(48,64,141)\">4. Communication </span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:26\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">If you feel lonely, your spouse will likely feel the same way, and they may feel hopeless about the relationship. You can start by asking your spouse at least one question a day and being a good listener to them. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:27\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Do not be shocked if your partner is skeptical at first. You can ask them about their day, what they are up to, and then pay attention to what they say. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:28\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">It only takes a change of energy and a rekindling of interest in your partner’s thoughts and feelings and openness to communicating your own to improve the relationship. </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:29\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(138,164,175)\">Wrapping Up </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:30\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">You can alleviate loneliness in marriage by turning toward one another.

I had already broken the Covid travel taboo by doing two runs to Goa within the last three months and also a quick visit to Portugal to collect my passport and citizenship card. This time, I was accompanied by my husband Joseph and my younger son Leroy to Portugal. For Joseph, who is usually a frequent traveler, it was going to be his first after two years!</span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:3\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Vouzela, near Viseu was our first long drive early the next day. We were invited by Joseph’s Portuguese teacher to spend a weekend with him. We followed the ‘A1 autostrada’ almost upto Porto but turned into Vouzela some kilometers from the famous city of port wines from the Douro valley. Rafa and Lucia were rolling back their great wooden gate, just as we reached their property. It was a sight to behold – fresh and green with ‘Carvalhos’ (Oak trees) and ‘Sobreiros’ (Cork trees) lining a bubbling<span> mountain stream that cut right across their property. Even before we could enter their house, we were excitedly running towards a lemon trees, chillies and cabbages growing on the land. They even had a greenhouse with vegetables growing in there!</span></paragraph-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:1\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_27-1.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:2\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_28-1.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:3\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_28-5.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:4\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_28-3.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:5\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_28-7.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:4\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">We stopped at the very top of a mountain where we made a ‘selfie stop’ at a swing that was placed precariously at the edge of a steep slope. The photo below will save a few words, describing the experience. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:5\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">The descent into the deep valley was treacherous and Rafa being a local was an expert driver and guide. The surprise was the ‘Aldeia de Pena’, which is a medieval village nestled by mountains, in a deep valley. Here one sees many houses with exposed stone walls and slate roofs. The pity is that there are hardly about 12 people living there! The one thing you cannot miss is a hearty village meal with the best Portuguese wine. This place is excellent for ‘carnivores’ and vegetarians will be left picking on oven-baked potatoes to keep their hunger at bay. The cooking is done on traditional stoves and ovens fired by firewood. One cannot and should not walk away without buying honey here – It is the best you can find in the entire country! </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:6\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Reversing the cars to get out of the valley wasn’t an easy job but Joseph somehow managed to keep us from falling into the ravine! Up we went, back the same route we came until we joined the road to Lamego. By the time we entered Lamego, we were famished, as we did not find place in the<span> Pena village restaurant, which was teeming with locals from around the place, enjoying a weekend meal out with their families. After stuffing ourselves with ‘Bifanas’ and ‘Pregos’ in the plaza in front of the famous ‘Se of Lamego’, we tried to climb the innumerable stairs up to the church at the top of the hill. However, due to failing light and the fact that some of us had to do another 3 hours driving back to Lisbon, we settled to doing some quick ‘presunto and chorico’ shopping in Lamego</span><span> The wind was chilly (about 2 degrees) and we decided not to stay outside too long. We passed many tall horizontal axis wind turbines which provide alternative electric energy to many parts of the country.</span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:7\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">We had no idea Rafa had yet another surprise<span> stop for us. We thought he was leading us to the highway however, he squeezed in a short visit to ‘Sao Pedro Do Sul’ where the famous royal baths are situated. Apparently, the kings and queens of Portugal vacationed here in winter to relax in the hot Sulphur springs. The place was absolutely lovely. It was sad that we did not have time to experience the hot baths however, we left the place with a longing to return. One has to book online before he can enter the baths.</span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:8\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">The next morning, we decided to leave for another long drive into Fatima, the much-revered shrine of the Marian apparitions, we visit every time we come to Portugal. The usual 1.5 hour journey took us just over two hours to complete, thanks to our cousin Tereza who boasted of going there 600 times but yet made us lose our way! </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:9\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">The chapel holding Mother Mary’s statue with the crown holding the bullet that was embedded in St. Pope John Paul II, in the failed assassination attempt, is also another solemn place to reflect on forgiveness (Pope John Paul II visited his assassin in prison and forgave him!). </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:10\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Lisbon is an exciting city and we visited many friends and family and<span> spent some quality time with them over lunches and dinners.</span></paragraph-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:6\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_29-1.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:11\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Food and wine deserve a separate article and I purposely leave them out for another time. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:12\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">If you would like to know more about Portugal, we would be happy to help out.

This triggered her to create a platform and community called All SHE Makes, which now provides hundreds of women artists the resources and opportunities to develop and grow commercially.</span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:4\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Born and raised in Rivne, a city in western Ukraine, Svitlana was 16 when she went to the US on a student-exchange programme. “No one prepared me for the culture shock,” she says. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:5\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">“The climate, the way people lived their lives, dependence on vehicles, lack of city-like living, the inability to have the same opportunities as other people due to visa restrictions, and constantly being singled out and having my intelligence questioned simply due to being an immigrant from Eastern Europe – this put me in survival mode for years.” </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:6\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Because of these difficulties, Svitlana took longer than usual to complete college. A bad relationship that ended <span>with her in therapy also led her to take up clinical psychology in her undergrad. Soon after, she began working on her art career.</span></paragraph-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:0\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_21-1.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:7\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">A move from Texas to Michigan along with her partner gave Svitlana everything she needed at the time. “The Michigan climate is identical to Ukraine, and the area we live in resembles city living, which I missed so much,” she narrates, sharing that she connected with a local art community and participated in art events for the first time in her life. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:8\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">After spending more time studying art history, Svitlana realised that local women artists only had limited avenues to show their work. “Throughout history and in today’s world, women artists remain underrepresented. Only 13.7 percent of living artists in major US museums and galleries are women. This doesn’t make any sense,” she says. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:9\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Svitlana started looking into the gender disparities and was dismayed to realise there wasn’t enough activism about it. “Being an artist, I wanted to see if there was a way that I could contribute to making a difference. My idea for All SHE Makes was born from a desire to create an international directory and a global access to quality art by women artists, because the most common question I got was ‘where do you find artists?’,” she says. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:10\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Launched on January 1, 2020, All SHE Makes grew during the Covid pandemic. Svitlana believes it is important to emphasise the lack of women’s representation in the art circuit. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:11\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">“We cannot change anything if we don’t highlight the main issue or the people it affects. We thought art history included all artists, but it turns out this couldn’t be further from the truth. We trust museums to give us the correct history, but that’s not the reality when the artists shown are 80 percent white male,” she says. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:12\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Svitlana’s study of psychology informed her further about art and art practices. “Having a huge fascination for the human mind keeps me perpetually excited about art,” says the artist and entrepreneur, who believes there are no limits to the way people use art, and each story is equally inspiring. “There are as many perspectives as there are people,” she says. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:13\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">After lockdown restrictions eased and in-person events started again, her goal with All SHE Makes remains the same – increasing visibil- <span>ity for women artists. “We may use different tools and avenues for doing that, but the main idea is always bringing attention to the incredible achievements of women artists who are constantly overlooked,” explains Svitlana, who is now based in Paris. </span></paragraph-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:1\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_22-5.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:2\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_22-3.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:3\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_22-6.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:4\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_22-1.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:5\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_23-5.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:14\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">All SHE Makes helps artists build their CV by offering monetary support in form of scholarships, community support via networking and art critique events, visibility via art exhibits, and publishing opportunities through the All SHE Makes art magazine. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:15\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">“We try to avoid concentrating so much on the importance of being a fulltime artist, because for some that may not even be the goal,” she says. “Our annual scholarship is available to all directory artists, and artists can use it for anything from babysitting costs to project starters.” Indian artists too have made it to All SHE Makes, including Charuka Arora, Pallavi Singh, Farheen Fatima and Niha Nathersa. “Charuka is an incredible human exploring her own artistic journey. She is passionate about taking creativity and arts to the masses and in creating meaningful communities. Pallavi’s work is exploring the grooming culture amongst Indian men, which is showing a change from the traditional alpha male,” explains Svitlana. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:16\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">She goes on: “Farheen is a self-taught photographer and that’s why her process is experimental. Niha is artist and art therapist. She says she processes the goings-on in her life through her painting; it is meditative and therapeutic for her.” Svitlana believes women artists deserve and “are owed” a premier place in museums, galleries, and commercial settings. “Women artists graduate with MFA degrees at higher rates than men, but we do not see that play out in the art market. When you go shopping for art or visiting galleries and museums, take a note how many of the artists are women,” she says. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:17\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">She also asserts that there are various income streams available to women artists, such as fine-art licensing, limited-edition prints, taking part in public-art projects such as murals, and taking art workshops online. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:18\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">“Artists are more accepting of the notion that an art career is whatever you make of it,” she says. “There is no right or wrong anymore. We all create our own journey with what we have.”</paragraph-widget></page-widget>",

Divided by class but united in fandom, they remain steadfast in their search for intimacy, independence and fun. Embracing Hindi film idol Shah Rukh Khan allows them a small respite from an oppressive culture. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:4\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Trained in development economics at Delhi University and Harvard University, Bhattacharya has focused on issues related to social policy and jobs since 2014 in her role as an economist at a multilateral development bank. Prior to this, she worked on research projects with the Centre for Policy Research, SEWA Union and Institute of Social Studies Trust. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:5\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">In this exclusive interview, she talks to us<span> among other things about why SRK embodies indepen- dence and a kind of ideal love for young women in India, the qualities of his character that young women seek in their partners, and some of the startling findings that she came across in her research.</span></paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:6\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_italic\" style=\"color: rgb(64,143,191)\">Tell our readers how you decided to write your recent book Desperately Seeking Shah Rukh. </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:7\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Through a series of accidents and research projects, I met SRK fans from different classes and communities across India. These women in my book form a fan-club that exists in my head; but they are not only fans of SRK; they are also fans of their own economic independence. For more than a decade, through repeated interviews, I followed these women and their quest to find love and livelihoods. My hope was to simply tell their stories, while using data to explain the socio-economic contexts that informed their dreams and disappointments. When I say the<span> women in my book are seeking</span><span> SRK, I do not mean they are worshipping or chasing a celebrity. They are seeking the freedom and finances to watch SRK; they are seeking men and families who will love them for who they are and support their choices. It sounds simple but the book shows you how difficult this search is for any Indian woman today.</span></paragraph-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:1\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_38-2.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:8\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">The book is not about Mr Khan, it is about the staggering gender crisis in our economy. India is in the bottom five countries of the world when it comes to women’s economic freedoms and participation. Drawing on 30 years of data, academic literature and personal stories, I try to unpack and explain this crisis to the reader. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:9\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">My hope was to convey the economic data in an accessible way, while also highlighting the emotions and messy realities behind the alarming statistics. I wrote it for anyone—irrespec- tive of whether they are SRK fans or not—interested in understanding womanhood in contemporary India, and how the economy is shaping our self-worth. </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:10\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_italic\" style=\"color: rgb(64,143,191)\">What process did you use to write it, and how long did it take you to complete? </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:11\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Because I chose to<span> repeatedly interview the same women, the book took nearly 15 years to complete. A key decision was to rely on Mr Khan as an anchor for the research, as opposed to following a more conventional research route, where I would directly ask women about their lives. In 2006, I was in my early twenties, and employed as a research assistant by a feminist think tank to undertake surveys of women working in different sectors across India. As I asked these women questions about their wages, working conditions and employment issues, several seemed rather bored of my questions.</span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:12\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Many of these women, from garment-workers in the villages of UP to women making incense sticks for quarter of minimum wage in the slums of Ahmedabad, were fighting for their own economic rights. They were arguing with employers, they were unionizing and organizing as workers and sisters. They really did not an outsider like me to ask them these questions. So, as an icebreaker, we would talk about the few things we had in common. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:13\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Everywhere I went, I met fellow SRK fans. As I probed more about why and when they watched Khan, these women started talking about why and when their families, workplaces and romances treated them poorly. They started using his songs, scenes and interviews to talk about the men in their real lives, their own hopes for freedom. These conversations led to the book. </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:14\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_italic\" style=\"color: rgb(64,143,191)\">What were some of the interesting/startling findings that you came across in your research? </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:15\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">The fact that doing something as simple as watching your favourite movie-star is so incredibly difficult for most women in the country should startle all of us. The data on the rapid removal of women from the paid workforce is well-known among economists but continues to shock me. I use several data sources to highlight how women, especially those working outside the home, have barely any free time for fun or rest. The degree of emotional and physical surveillance on women’s bodies and hearts revealed by the stories is deeply worrying. On a more hopeful note, I was pleasantly surprised by how fandom for Khan served as an unusual research technique. In a country where we are so divided by religion, caste, income and language, the love for his icon allowed a space for so many women to connect with each other’s experiences. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:16\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">The love that SRK commands in so many hearts allowed me to enter into the lives of these women, it encouraged them to share their stories and use his filmography as language and metaphor. Seeing the power of popular Hindi cinema in uniting so many of us in laughter and tears was very powerful and moving. </paragraph-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:2\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_39-2.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:17\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_italic\" style=\"color: rgb(64,143,191)\">Why is Shah Rukh Khan an aspirational figure for young people in the country?

Each of the women I followed has constructed his persona, drawing on their own realities and his body of work. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:19\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">To many, he represents the promise and charge of India’s big market reforms in the 1990s; his meteoric rise was parallel to India’s economic growth and telecom boom. To others, he represents social mobility, a man who made it on his own without any entrenched network wealth. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:20\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">To most women in my book, he represents a progressive and loving masculinity (all these women ignore films where his characters stalk women or harm them), a man who is open about his feelings, does the dishes and engages deeply with<span> the needs of women. Some want to marry a man like him, others want to be him. He represents economic and romantic freedom; this is why he is aspirational.</span></paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:21\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_italic\" style=\"color: rgb(64,143,191)\">What are some of the qualities of Shah Rukh Khan’s character that young women seek in their partners? </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:22\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Each woman sees him very differently. Some do not want a partner like him, they want to be like SRK—to have his success, status and independence. But nearly all the women, across class backgrounds and regions, said they admired the way he listened to and talked to women. I kept hearing words like izzat, tameez and ‘respect’ all the time. </paragraph-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:3\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_40-1.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:23\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">A migrant domestic worker told me how his character in Rab Ne Bana di Jodi appreciates his wife’s labour in making the tiffin for him. I describe this in detail in the book. There are many such examples in the stories. Women appreciated his participating in the kitchen and how his characters performed significant emotional labour in their relationships with women. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:24\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">It is hardly surprising that these attributes are valued in a country where so many women’s labours and desires go unacknowledged and unappreciated. India is in the bottom five in the world when it comes to men helping in housework. Finally, each woman thinks he is wildly sexy; an admission that causes major parental discomfort in many conservative Indian homes featured in the book. </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:25\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_italic\" style=\"color: rgb(64,143,191)\">As an economist who works on subjects related to social policy and jobs, how did this theme of the female gaze resonate with you? </span></heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:26\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Economics tends to be a masculine profession. Feminists have fought to force the discipline to acknowledge and incorporate women’s realities more accurately into theories, solutions and the way data is measured and collected. Therefore, I was very keen to capture and document how women see the economy. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:27\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">I have always been very committed to doing a different kind of social science, one that is more grounded and one that genuinely listens to the people we claim to study and write about. The book was also a way to liberate myself from the standard way academicians and technocrats write about the economy. </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:28\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\"><span class=\"ld_italic\" style=\"color: rgb(64,143,191)\">Personally, what is your opinion of SRK?

You know, the kind in office buildings and banks and other important places. You have to make up your mind about which direction you are going, in or out, and then just go for it. The undecided can go round and round forever.</span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:4\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Life is like that too. No one knows that better than me because I take forever in life’s turnstile doors. I can’t make up my mind about anything. The more important the decision, the more it freezes me into inaction. This is what happened when there was talk about finding a groom for me. I did not react in time to say that I did not want to get married. At least not to Harjeet, who insisted on being called Harry, because everyone in London called him that. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:5\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">At college, I secretly stole glances at Imtiaz. He always sat by the window in his class and when he wasn’t frowning at his books, he looked out at the sky. Just below which I stood, deliberately taking <span>my own sweet time to put my cycle on its stand and lock it and pick up my bag and adjust my dupatta, until his eyes descended from the clouds to where I was. I don’t know if it was a thought he had picked off the skies or it was the sight of me, but he always smiled. And he always pushed back his hair from his forehead. At that moment I felt a sudden need to get out of there as fast as possible.</span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:6\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Harry and I were to be married in a week because he had to be back in London before the start of the Christmas sale at his store. After that <span>first time when he came with his parents to “see” me, he came to our house often. He sat in the courtyard with my father and ate everything that was brought out. Sometimes he’d walk to a corner and talk in hushed tones on the phone with his family and then give instructions to mine. My father, as tough and unshakable as the neem tree in the courtyard, turned as pliant as vine when Harry spoke to him. My mother was an unrecognizable mess, a mix of giddy happiness and breathless panic. She packed stacks of sweets in the new shiny suitcase. She fought with the tailor to get my suits stitched in time. She unpacked and packed my bags again and again. I heard murmurs about the loan my father took from his office. I saw mother and him going to the bank and returning with all the jewellery from the locker. Everything she owned was in a small old black purse that she had tucked tightly under her armpit. The few times that Harry and I were left alone, so we could get to know each other, he talked nonstop about his store, his car, his house. When he spoke he waved his arms a lot and when the sun caught his golden watch, you could see fireflies on the courtyard walls in the afternoon. He asked me if I had a tongue in my mouth or if I just stared at walls like a cow. I cleared my throat and started to tell him about my college and friends. He looked at me with his head tilted. “Did they teach you to cook some good chicken at this college? More useful,” he sniggered. Then he picked up his phone and started to look through his messages. I didn’t reply nor continue what I was saying. He dialed a number and walked away to talk. When he wasn’t talking on the phone, he was staring into the phone. Harry never looked up at the sky.</span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:7\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">On the day of the wedding, I woke up with a start. There was a racket outside. I looked out of the bedroom window into the courtyard. There were familiar faces and strangers. Some men were putting up a shamiana in the courtyard, one of my uncles was shouting instructions to the halwais, father was giving our house help a piece of his mind, my brother and his friends were trying to hang a string of lights from the terrace. My younger cousins were practising their dance steps. I shut the window and sat down on my bed again. Everyone says that the wedding day is the happiest day in a girl’s life. Then why did I feel so numb? I am no fool. I know this is the best thing that could have happened to me. A life of comfort abroad was better than the best I could hope for here. The farthest I could dream of was to be a schoolteacher. I liked that thought but then again, if I lived abroad maybe I could help my family with some money and have my brother move abroad too. I felt better just thinking about it. My mother was calling out. I got up to get ready. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:8\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">The wedding itself didn’t take very long. Afterwards, Harry and I were made to sit down to eat lunch next to each other. He would sometimes lean close to my ear and whisper jokes that I didn’t understand, his voice thick with halfchewed food. I knew they were jokes because he would laugh non-stop for several minutes afterwards. The more confused I looked, the longer he laughed. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:9\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">It was late at night when we left for the airport. Harry’s parents were staying back to spend time with their relatives, so it was just us. I sat in the backseat, next to Harry. He fell asleep soon, his arms and legs spread across the back seat like a pinned rat in the biology lab. I looked out into <span>the darkness and cried all the way. For my parents whom I wouldn’t see again for a long time. For my friends Shabbo and Rani, who hugged me and cried so much they got their snot on my dupatta (that made us smile a little too). For my college professor who tried to talk my mother into letting me finish my degree but gave up when I told her I didn’t want her to call my mother because it upset her. For all the things I had to leave behind because Harry said it costs a lot of money if the luggage was even two-hundred-andfifty grams more than what’s allowed.</span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:10\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">And for Imtiaz, whom I saw on my last morning at college. I had spotted him from afar and quickly hid myself behind a wall. He was standing by the cycle stand. He seemed to be waiting for someone, looking at his wrist-watch again and again. I turned back and pedalled home as fast as I could. As the memory rose, I squeezed my eyes shut hard to get the image out of my brain forever. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:11\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">The taxi stopped. Harry jumped out and told the driver to put our luggage on a wheeled cart. I stepped out into the roar of cars, horns and people shouting. I felt like throwing up. Harry asked for me for my passport. I had put it in the inside pocket of my purse. My hands were clammy and my fingers were slipping, unable to open the zipper. With one sweep, Harry snatched the bag, ripped open the zip and pulled out the passport. He tossed the bag back in my hands and muttered something in English. I didn’t have to understand the words to feel their heat. Harry was striding towards the gate, tickets and passports in hand. He turned once and <span>gestured to me to follow. I hung my handbag on my shoulder and pushed the trolley to the gate, careful not to let the suitcases slide off.</span></paragraph-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:1\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_49-1.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:12\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">The airport was a vast cavernous belly of a giant whale and people were like chewed-up creatures floating in it. I was trying to keep pace with Harry and every time he dipped out of sight my heart skipped a beat. Just when I thought I had caught up with him, he stopped suddenly. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:13\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">“Stay here,” he told me, jabbing his finger at the floor. Before I could nod, he was gone. It was a relief, not having to push the mountain of suitcases and to just stand for a bit and look around. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:14\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">That’s when I saw her first. She was dressed like me, in a bright salwar suit and pretty gold jewellery, a white purse hanging from her shoulder. Her face was turned away and she was looking towards the long line a few feet away. A small girl was clinging to her leg and staring at me. Something about the child’s wideeyed gaze and open mouth made me smile. She immediately hid behind her mother’s leg, only to peep out again in a second. I put my palm on my eyes and then peeped out at her. She broke into a laugh. Her mother looked at me too. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:15\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">“You are very naughty,” the mother patted her daughter’s head in mock rebuke and smiled at me. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:16\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Just then a big suitcase fell down in front of us. At first I thought it was from my pile but it wasn’t. A tall man in a blue tracksuit had flung a suitcase <span>on the floor between the woman and me. He was hissing with anger. He flung open the suitcase and pulled the woman down by her elbow towards it.</span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:17\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">“Take this nonsense out NOW... stupid woman. Everything is overweight!” he was almost shouting. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:18\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">The woman was grabbing things as he flung them out. An old metal box came out first, then a hand-knitted sweater, polythene bags tied with rubber bands, a cheap plastic toy, a photo frame. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:19\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">The woman was red in the face, her dupatta had fallen off her chest to the floor. She was apologising to her husband, trying to make him stop. “Uncouth villagers like you... six hundred times you travel from India, each time you bring garbage and expect me to pay for it! What can I expect for marrying a bloody sweeper’s daughter?” </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:20\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">The woman looked up for a second. Her eyes caught mine and were locked for what seemed like a long time. But it wasn’t that long after all. She looked away, embarrassed. People were walking around the stuff on the floor, trying to not look at the drama unfolding at their feet. A kindly looking lady in uniform was telling the man to calm down and move everything to a corner. The little girl was wailing, trying to grab her mother’s arm. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:21\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">My chest was heaving with fear and anger and shame. I was that woman. Or would be soon. Her eyes had drilled a hole in my heart and every lie I had told myself flowed out of it in an unstoppable gush. And with it, something in me collapsed to pieces. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:22\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">I saw Harry gesturing to me from the line. I was looking at him but it was as if my limbs were bolted to the floor. I saw Harry leave the line and come towards me really fast. He was frowning with irritation. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:23\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Before he could say anything, I turned to face him. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:24\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">“I can’t come with you Harry,” I said. “This was a mistake... my mistake.” </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:25\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">“Have you lost your mind, you idi…” </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:26\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">I didn’t wait to hear the rest of what he had to say. I turned away. I was walking... walking faster… </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:27\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">“Stop,” someone said behind me. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:28\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">I didn’t stop. I couldn’t stop. My heartbeat and the sound of my heels on the floor were one. I was running. “Madam... Madam… you can’t go out this way!” a man called out. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:29\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">I threw myself at the turnstile door and pushed my way out. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:30\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Outside, the sun was about to come out and the air was cool and pink. I stopped to look up and the sky spread itself out for me to fly. </paragraph-widget><image-widget widget-id=\"P:2\" source=\"https://cdn.magloft.com/pdf-import/521/images/img_50-1.jpg#image/jpeg\" padding=\"8 0 16 0\"></image-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:31\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_italic\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">Arti Jain studied New Media at Stanford University, holds an MFA in cinema from San Francisco State University and an MA in mass communications from Jamia Millia Islamia.

A well-written letter can attract the right kind of attention and generate positive results. Here are some useful tips on writing a complaint letter: </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:3\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">Be Straightforward </span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:4\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Don’t add unnecessary details in the letter. Explain the scenario and what exactly happened that made you write the letter. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:5\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">Mention All Details </span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:6\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Describe the item or service you purchased as <span>well as the issue. Include serial or model numbers, as well as the seller’s name and address. If you’re following up on a conversation, make sure to include who you spoke with and what you talked about.</span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:7\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">Don’t Be Unreasonable </span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:8\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Don’t expect unrealistic or unreasonable solutions. Give specific details about what you want done and how long you’re willing to wait for a response. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:9\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">Don’t Be Threatening </span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:10\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Write a letter that isn’t threatening, snarky, or angry. The person who reads your letter is unlikely to be the source of the problem, but he or she may be able to assist you in addressing it. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:11\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">Attach Relevant Documents </span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:12\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Copies of essential papers, such as warranties, receipts, and work orders, should be included. You may also want to include copies of emails and notes from any discussions you’ve had with the seller regarding the issue. </paragraph-widget><heading-widget widget-id=\"T:13\" type=\"h3\" padding=\"0 24 16 24\">Camping for Beginners</heading-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:14\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">MW guide on camping safely in the great outdoors – enjoy the adventure! </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:15\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">There’s nothing better than camping to explore the great outdoors and spend quality time with your loved ones. If you’re a novice camper, here are our top recommendations for making your first trip pleasurable and stress-free: </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:16\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">1. Make a Meal Plan </span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:17\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">A novice camper may save a lot of time and aggravation by preparing their meals and cooking them ahead of time. Check the camping laws to check if campfires are allowed, and if things don’t go according to plan, look into nearby bars and restaurants for a place to dine! </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:18\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">2. Choose the Right Outfits for the Outdoors </span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:19\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">People’s wardrobe preferences change with the seasons. If it’s freezing outside, wearing a base layer during camping will keep you warm. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:20\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">In the summer, the best material for a shirt is a lightweight, moisture-wicking cloth. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:21\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">3. Bring Toiletries for Camping </span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:22\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">All of your prescription drugs and personal hygiene products are essential. A separate firstaid kit provides an entire supply of materials in a conveniently compact package. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:23\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Bring sunscreen and insect repellent with you on your camping trip. Carry an adequate amount of toilet paper, soap, and a tiny towel with you to a campground since supplies might run out.

Relax and Have Fun! </span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:25\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">From preparing supper to cleaning your teeth, almost everything takes a bit longer at a campground. Go with the flow rather than following the rules. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:26\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Your kids may want to stay up late the first night, but this may not be the case for the next three or four evenings as they may <span>become exhausted.</span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:27\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">5. Follow the Set of Laws for Appropriate Trash Disposal </span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:28\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Dishwater and food scraps dumped in the trees behind new campers can attract wildlife and create unsanitary conditions for subsequent campers, which is frustrating. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:29\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Most camp grounds have designated areas for disposing of gray water, such as sinks in the restrooms or a gravel drainage site. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:30\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">6. Wear Appropriate Outfits for the Night </span></paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:31\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Make sure you have enough sleepwear for your trip’s evening temperatures. Your sleeping bag is rated for temperatures ranging from 0 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit. While it’s essential to avoid being too chilly at night, it’s also essential to avoid being too hot. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:32\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\">Temperatures in the evening should fall within a 10-15-degree range. If the weather changes, you won’t have to worry about being cold or hot. An inflatable sleeping pad and pillow can be very helpful and it does not take up a lot of packing room. </paragraph-widget><paragraph-widget widget-id=\"T:33\" padding=\"0 24 8 24\"><span class=\"ld_bold\" style=\"color: rgb(38,37,35)\">7.
